# Image_Caption_Generator_using_AI
This project is a multimodal AI application that automatically generates smart, context-aware captions for any uploaded image using Salesforceâ€™s BLIP (Bootstrapped Language Image Pretraining) model.  Built using Python, PyTorch, and Hugging Face Transformers, the app provides an easy-to-use Gradio interface for real-time caption generation.
